  "question": "How to create node express app",
  // eslint-disable-next-line
  "answer": "To create a Node Express app, follow the steps below:</br></br>1. Set up a new Node project by creating a new directory and running the command `npm init` in the terminal. This will generate a `package.json` file for your project.</br></br>2. Install Express by running `npm install express` in the terminal.</br></br>3. Create a new JavaScript file, such as `app.js`, and require the Express module at the beginning of the file by adding the following code: </br></br>```javascript</br>const express = require('express');</br>const app = express();</br>```</br></br>4. Define the routes for your app by adding the necessary HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and route paths using the `app` object. For example:</br></br>```javascript</br>app.get('/', (req, res) => {</br>res.send('Hello World!');</br>});</br></br> app.post('/users', (req, res) => {</br>// Handle the request for creating a new user</br>});</br></br>app.put('/users/:id', (req, res) => {</br></br>// Handle the request for updating a user with a specific ID</br></br>});</br></br>app.delete('/users/:id', (req, res) => {</br>// Handle the request for deleting a user with a specific ID</br>});</br>```</br></br> 5. Start the server by adding the following code at the end of the file:</br></br>```javascript</br>const port = 3000; // Choose a port number of your choice</br>app.listen(port, () => {</br>console.log(`Server is listening on port ${port}`); </br>});</br>```</br></br>6. Run the app by executing `node app.js` in the terminal. Your Express app will now be listening on the specified port, and you can visit the defined routes in your browser or using API testing tools like Postman.</br></br>These are the basic steps to create a Node Express app. You can further customize and enhance your app by adding middleware, database connections, and additional routes and logic as per your requirements."

You can write your app logic and UI code here.<br>   - Use the `/app/styles/` folder to store your CSS or SCSS files for styling.<br>   - The generated app also includes example extension points like `Product` and `Cart`. You can modify these or create new extension points as required.<br><br>7. To run and test your app locally, use the following command:<br><br>   ```<br>   shopify serve<br>   ```<br><br>   This will start a local server so you can view and test your app in a development environment.<br><br>8. When you're ready to deploy your app to a Shopify store, use the following command:<br><br>   ```<br>   shopify deploy<br>   ```<br><br>   This will prompt you to create a new Shopify development store or choose an existing store to install your app into.<br><br>That's it! You now have a basic remix Shopify app created using the Shopify CLI. You can further enhance and customize your app by integrating with Shopify's APIs and using additional tools and libraries."
